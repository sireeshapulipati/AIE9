Gentle stretching and strengthening exercises can help alleviate discomfort and prevent future episodes.\\n\\nRecommended exercises for lower back pain include:\\n- Cat-Cow Stretch: Start on hands and knees, alternate between arching your back up (cat) and letting it sag down (cow). Do 10-15 repetitions.\\n- Bird Dog: From hands and knees, extend opposite arm and leg while keeping your core engaged. Hold for 5 seconds, then switch sides. Do 10 repetitions per side.\\n- Partial Crunches: Lie on your back with knees bent, cross arms over chest, tighten stomach muscles and raise shoulders off floor. Hold briefly, then lower. Do 8-12 repetitions.\\n- Knee-to-Chest Stretch: Lie on your back, pull one knee toward your chest while keeping the other foot flat.

    "Before we do that, let's stop and think a bit about how OpenAI's chat models work.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know they have roles - as is indicated in the following API [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat/create-messages)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three roles, and they function as follows (taken directly from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/chat-completions-api)):\n",
    "\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"system\"}` : The system message helps set the behavior of the assistant. For example, you can modify the personality of the assistant or provide specific instructions about how it should behave throughout the conversation. However note that the system message is optional and the model’s behavior without a system message is likely to be similar to using a generic message such as \"You are a helpful assistant.\"\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"user\"}` : The user messages provide requests or comments for the assistant to respond to.\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"assistant\"}` : Assistant messages store previous assistant responses, but can also be written by you to give examples of desired behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You start with a system message that outlines how the LLM should respond, what kind of behaviours you can expect from it, and more\n",
    "2. Then, you can provide a few examples in the form of \"assistant\"/\"user\" pairs\n",
    "3. Then, you prompt the model with the true \"user\" message.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll be forgoing the 2nd step for simplicity's sake."
