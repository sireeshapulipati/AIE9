2. Improve sleep quality and consistency.
3. Incorporate quick stress relief techniques for the workplace and longer sessions for home.
4. Establish a proper evening routine to complement exercise and enhance sleep.
5. Provide sleep hygiene recommendations and optimal bedtime practices.

## Work Stress Management Techniques:
### Quick Stress-Relief Techniques (At work):
- **Deep Breathing Exercise:** Take 5 deep breaths, inhaling for a count of 4 and exhaling for a count of 6. This can be done anywhere.
- **5-4-3-2-1 Grounding Technique:** Identify 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.
- **Short Walks:** Take a 5-minute break every hour to walk and stretch. Ideally outside for fresh air.
- **Mindful Sipping:** Take a moment to enjoy a hot drink. Focus on the warmth, aroma, and taste to ground yourself.

### Longer Practices (At home):
- **Evening Meditation (10-15 mins):** Sit comfortably, close your eyes, and focus on your breath. Allow thoughts to come and go without judgment.
- **Journaling (10 mins):** Write down your thoughts, worries, or gratitude each evening to clear your mind before bedtime.
- **Progressive Muscle Relaxation (15 mins):** Tense and then relax each muscle group progressively throughout your body to release tension.

## Daily Practices (For 2 weeks):
### Week 1:
- **Monday:** 5-minute deep breathing + 10-minute evening meditation

### Week 2:
**Repeat Week 1 with variations**:

- Alternate journaling themes (e.g., gratitude, stressors, reflections).

## Sleep Hygiene Recommendations:
- **Consistent Sleep Schedule:** Aim to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day.
- **Wind Down Routine:** Start winding down at least an hour before bed—limit screen time, engage in calming activities.
- **Comfortable Sleep Environment:** Ensure your bedroom is dark, cool, and quiet. Consider blackout curtains and white noise machines if needed.
- **Limit Stimulants:** Avoid caffeine and heavy meals close to bedtime.

## Evening Routines Complementing Evening Exercise Schedule:
- **Post-Exercise Cool Down (10 mins):** Stretch major muscle groups and engage in deep breathing following workouts to release physical tension.
- **Relaxation Shower/Bath (20 mins):** Warm water helps signal to the body that it’s time to wind down.
- **Bedtime Ritual (15 mins):** Engage in a calming activity such as reading or gentle stretching before sleep. Turn off all screens at least 30 minutes before bed.
