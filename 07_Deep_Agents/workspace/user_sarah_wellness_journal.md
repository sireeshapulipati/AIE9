## Day 1 Check-in
**Date:** Today  
**Energy Level:** Feeling great!  
**Mood:** Positive and motivated  
**Completed Activities:** Just starting the challenge  
**Notes:** First day - feeling excited and ready to begin this wellness journey!  

**Tomorrow's Focus:** Begin with the morning yoga routine and implement the gentle energy-boosting meal plan designed for your vegan lifestyle and energy goals.

## Day 2 Check-in
**Date:** Day 2  
**Energy Level:** 2/5 (feeling tired)  
**Mood:** 3/5 (okay but concerned about energy)  
**Completed Activities:** 
- ✅ Morning meditation 
- ✅ Stuck to meal plan
- ❌ Missed yesterday's workout

**Notes:** Successfully maintained meditation practice and nutrition goals, but missed workout and experiencing fatigue. Need to address energy management given chronic condition.

**Adaptations for Day 3:** Given your current fatigue and chronic condition affecting energy levels:
1. **Gentle Movement:** Instead of a full workout, try 10-15 minutes of gentle stretching or restorative yoga
2. **Energy-Supporting Foods:** Focus on iron-rich vegan foods (spinach, lentils, pumpkin seeds) and B12 sources
3. **Rest Integration:** Allow for an extra 15-minute rest period mid-day if possible
4. **Meditation Adjustment:** Keep meditation short (5-10 minutes) to avoid mental fatigue

**Remember:** It's completely normal to have low-energy days, especially with your chronic condition. The goal is consistency, not perfection!

## Day 3 Check-in
**Date:** Day 3  
**Energy Level:** Improving (able to complete workout)  
**Mood:** Mixed - accomplished with exercise/nutrition, but restless with meditation  
**Completed Activities:** 
- ✅ Workout completed 
- ✅ Nutrition goals met
- ⚠️ Meditation attempted but felt restless

**Notes:** Great bounce-back with physical activity and nutrition! Energy appears to be recovering from Day 2's fatigue. Experiencing restlessness during meditation - this is actually quite common and indicates your energy levels are improving.

**Adaptations for Day 4:** Since your energy is returning but meditation feels challenging:
1. **Movement-Based Mindfulness:** Try walking meditation or gentle yoga flow instead of seated meditation
2. **Shorter Sessions:** Reduce meditation to 3-5 minutes until restlessness settles
3. **Active Mindfulness:** Practice mindful eating during meals or mindful breathing during workouts
4. **Body Scan Alternative:** Try a progressive muscle relaxation while lying down instead of traditional meditation
5. **Timing Adjustment:** Experiment with meditation right after your workout when your body is naturally more settled

**Celebration:** You didn't let yesterday's low energy derail you - you got back on track with both movement and nutrition! This shows real resilience.
