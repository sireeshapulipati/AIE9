# Sleep Hygiene Best Practices - Evidence-Based Strategies

## Scientific Foundation

### What is Sleep Hygiene?
Sleep hygiene refers to environmental and behavioral factors that promote consistent, quality sleep. Research demonstrates that optimizing these factors can improve sleep onset, sleep efficiency, and overall sleep quality.

### Key Research Findings
- Bedroom environment accounts for 15-20% of sleep quality variation
- Temperature regulation is critical for sleep initiation and maintenance
- Noise disruption fragments sleep even when not consciously noticed
- Light exposure timing affects melatonin production and circadian rhythms
- Bedtime routines create psychological cues for sleep preparation

## Evidence-Based Environmental Optimization

### 1. Temperature Control
**Scientific Basis**: Core body temperature drops 1-2°F during sleep initiation

**Optimal Guidelines**:
- Bedroom temperature: 65-68°F (18-20°C)
- Slightly cooler better than warmer for most people
- Individual variation exists (adjust within range based on comfort)

**Implementation**:
- Use programmable thermostat to lower temperature 1-2 hours before bedtime
- Breathable sleepwear and bedding materials
- Fan for air circulation and white noise
- Cooling mattress pad or pillow for hot sleepers
- Warm bath/shower 90 minutes before bed (raises then drops body temperature)

### 2. Light Environment Management
**Scientific Basis**: Even small amounts of light can suppress melatonin production

**Darkness Optimization**:
- Complete darkness during sleep (or as dark as possible)
- Blackout curtains or window coverings
- Eye mask as backup or for travel
- Cover or remove LED lights from electronics
- Use dim, warm lighting for nighttime bathroom trips

**Strategic Light Use**:
- Bright light upon waking to signal day start
- Gradual light dimming 2-3 hours before bedtime
- Red-filtered nightlights for safety without circadian disruption
- Light therapy lamp for morning routine (10,000 lux, 20-30 minutes)

### 3. Sound Environment
**Scientific Basis**: Noise above 35 decibels can fragment sleep architecture

**Noise Reduction**:
- Identify and minimize noise sources
- Earplugs (silicone or foam, properly fitted)
- White noise machine or fan for sound masking
- Heavy curtains for external sound dampening
- Rugs or carpets to reduce footstep noise

**Beneficial Sounds**:
- Consistent white, pink, or brown noise
- Nature sounds (rain, ocean waves, forest sounds)
- Avoid music with varying volumes or tempos
- Use sound machines with timer functions

### 4. Air Quality and Ventilation
**Scientific Basis**: Poor air quality and stuffiness can disrupt sleep quality

**Optimization Strategies**:
- Ensure adequate ventilation (crack window or use fan)
- Maintain humidity between 30-50%
- Use air purifier if needed for allergens or pollutants
- Keep bedroom clean and dust-free
- Remove or minimize allergen sources (pets, certain plants)
- Consider houseplants that improve nighttime air quality

## Sleep Environment Setup

### 1. Mattress and Pillow Optimization
**Scientific Basis**: Proper spinal alignment and pressure point relief improve sleep quality

**Mattress Guidelines**:
- Replace every 7-10 years or when showing wear
- Medium-firm generally optimal for most people
- Consider body weight, sleep position, and personal preference
- Allow 30-90 day trial period for adjustment

**Sleep Position Considerations**:
- **Back sleepers**: Medium-firm mattress, thin pillow
- **Side sleepers**: Medium-soft to medium-firm, thicker pillow to fill neck gap
- **Stomach sleepers**: Firm mattress, thin or no pillow

**Pillow Selection**:
- Replace every 1-2 years
- Height should maintain neutral spine alignment
- Material choice based on temperature preference and allergies

### 2. Bedding and Sleepwear
**Scientific Basis**: Moisture-wicking and temperature-regulating materials improve comfort

**Fabric Recommendations**:
- Natural fibers: Cotton, linen, bamboo, wool
- Moisture-wicking synthetic materials for hot sleepers
- Avoid heavy, non-breathable materials

**Bedding Layers**:
- Lightweight, breathable sheets
- Temperature-appropriate blankets/comforters
- Layer system for easy temperature adjustment

### 3. Bedroom Organization
**Scientific Basis**: Cluttered environments can increase stress and anxiety

**Organization Principles**:
- Keep bedroom primarily for sleep and intimacy
- Minimize clutter and distracting elements
- Ensure easy navigation in darkness
- Remove work materials and exercise equipment
- Create calm, peaceful atmosphere with neutral colors

## Behavioral Sleep Hygiene Practices

### 1. Pre-Sleep Routine Development
**Scientific Basis**: Consistent routines create conditioned responses for sleep preparation

**Timing**: Begin 30-90 minutes before intended bedtime

**Essential Elements**:
- Consistent sequence of activities
- Relaxing, low-stimulation activities
- Dim lighting throughout routine
- Same timing each night (including weekends)

**Sample 30-Minute Routine**:
1. Dim lights and put away screens (5 minutes)
2. Personal hygiene (brush teeth, wash face) (10 minutes)
3. Relaxation activity (reading, stretching, meditation) (15 minutes)

**Sample 60-Minute Routine**:
1. Complete daily tasks and prepare for tomorrow (15 minutes)
2. Light cleaning or organizing (10 minutes)
3. Personal care and hygiene (15 minutes)
4. Relaxation activities (reading, gentle yoga, journaling) (20 minutes)

### 2. Stress and Worry Management
**Scientific Basis**: Racing thoughts and anxiety are primary causes of sleep onset difficulty

**Cognitive Techniques**:
- **Worry Journal**: Write concerns and tomorrow's tasks 2-3 hours before bed
- **Gratitude Practice**: List 3-5 things you're grateful for
- **Progressive Muscle Relaxation**: Systematically tense and release muscle groups
- **4-7-8 Breathing**: Inhale 4, hold 7, exhale 8 (repeat 4-8 cycles)

**Mindfulness Practices**:
- Body scan meditation (10-20 minutes)
- Guided sleep meditations
- Mindful breathing focus
- Present-moment awareness techniques

### 3. Activity Timing Optimization
**Scientific Basis**: Certain activities have time-dependent effects on sleep quality

**Evening Activity Guidelines**:

**2-3 Hours Before Bed**:
- Finish vigorous exercise
- Complete large meals
- Finish caffeinated beverages
- Address stressful tasks or difficult conversations

**1-2 Hours Before Bed**:
- Begin light dimming
- Start pre-sleep routine
- Finish alcohol consumption
- Complete mentally stimulating activities

**30-60 Minutes Before Bed**:
- No screens or electronic stimulation
- Engage in calming activities only
- Prepare bedroom environment
- Practice relaxation techniques

## Substance and Timing Considerations

### 1. Caffeine Management
**Scientific Basis**: Caffeine blocks adenosine receptors, preventing natural sleep drive

**Guidelines**:
- No caffeine after 2pm (6-8 hours before bedtime)
- Individual sensitivity varies (some need 10+ hours)
- Hidden caffeine sources: chocolate, tea, some medications
- Gradual reduction to avoid withdrawal symptoms

### 2. Alcohol Considerations
**Scientific Basis**: Alcohol disrupts sleep architecture, particularly REM sleep

**Impact on Sleep**:
- Initially sedating but causes fragmented sleep
- Reduces REM sleep and deep sleep
- Causes early morning awakenings
- Worsens sleep apnea and snoring

**Guidelines**:
- Limit to 1-2 drinks per day maximum
- No alcohol 3-4 hours before bedtime
- Increase water intake if alcohol consumed
- Monitor sleep quality correlation with alcohol use

### 3. Food and Hydration Timing
**Scientific Basis**: Digestion and fluid balance affect sleep comfort

**Meal Timing**:
- Large meals 2-3 hours before bedtime
- Light snack if hungry closer to bedtime
- Avoid spicy, acidic, or high-fat foods in evening
- Consider foods with natural melatonin (cherries, nuts)

**Hydration Balance**:
- Adequate hydration during day
- Reduce fluid intake 2 hours before bed
- Small sips if thirsty during night
- Empty bladder before sleep routine

## Advanced Sleep Hygiene Strategies

### 1. Circadian Rhythm Support
**Scientific Basis**: Aligning activities with natural circadian patterns optimizes sleep

**Daily Rhythm Management**:
- Consistent meal times (supports circadian clocks)
- Regular exercise timing (morning or afternoon preferred)
- Strategic light exposure throughout day
- Temperature regulation awareness

### 2. Sleep-Wake Transition Optimization
**Scientific Basis**: Smooth transitions between sleep and wake states improve sleep efficiency

**Falling Asleep Techniques**:
- 4-7-8 breathing pattern
- Progressive muscle relaxation
- Visualization or guided imagery
- Counting or repetitive mental tasks

**Middle-of-Night Awakenings**:
- Avoid checking time (creates anxiety)
- Stay in bed if awakening <20 minutes
- Use relaxation techniques
- Get out of bed if awake >20-30 minutes, return when sleepy

### 3. Weekend and Travel Considerations
**Scientific Basis**: Consistency across all days maintains circadian rhythm stability

**Weekend Guidelines**:
- Maintain similar bedtime (within 1 hour of weekday schedule)
- Limit sleep-in time to 1 hour maximum
- Keep morning light exposure consistent
- Avoid "social jet lag" from dramatic schedule shifts

**Travel Sleep Hygiene**:
- Pack sleep essentials (eye mask, earplugs, comfortable sleepwear)
- Maintain bedtime routine as much as possible
- Address new environment factors (temperature, light, noise)
- Gradual adjustment for time zone changes
