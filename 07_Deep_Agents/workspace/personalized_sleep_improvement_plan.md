**Week 6**: If you went to bed after 10:45pm, aim for 10:45pm

### Technology Management Protocol:

## Emergency Protocols

2. Practice 4-7-8 breathing: Inhale 4, hold 7, exhale 8 (repeat 4-8 times)
3. Progressive muscle relaxation
4. If still awake after 20 minutes, get up and do quiet activity until sleepy

### For Inconsistent Schedule Days:
1. Maintain wake time regardless of bedtime
2. Get morning light exposure ASAP
3. Avoid afternoon/evening naps
4. Return to routine the next evening
