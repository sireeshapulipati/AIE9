# Running the MCP Server

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
uv sync
```

### 2. Set up environment variables

Copy the example env file and fill in your OpenAI API key:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### 3. Run the MCP server locally

```bash
uv run server.py
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:8000`.

### 4. Expose the server with ngrok (for remote/Claude Desktop access)

In a separate terminal, start an ngrok tunnel:

```bash
ngrok http 8000
```

Copy the ngrok forwarding URL (e.g. `https://xxxx-xx-xx-xx-xx.ngrok-free.app`) and restart the server with it:

```bash
ISSUER_URL=https://xxxx-xx-xx-xx-xx.ngrok-free.app uv run server.py
```

> **Note:** The `ISSUER_URL` must match the public URL clients use to reach the server, otherwise OAuth authentication will fail.

# Build 🏗️

In today's assignment, we'll be building an MCP server with OAuth authentication — a cat shop application that exposes tools for browsing products, managing a cart, and checking out.

- 🤝 Breakout Room #1
  - Set up the MCP server with OAuth and the product database
  - Explore the MCP tools: `list_products`, `get_product`, `add_to_cart`, `view_cart`, `remove_from_cart`, `checkout`

- 🤝 Breakout Room #2
  - Connect an MCP client to the server
  - Build an end-to-end interaction flow using the MCP tools

# Ship 🚢

The completed MCP server and client integration!

### Deliverables

- A short Loom of either:
  - the MCP server you built and a demo of the client interacting with it; or
  - the notebook you created for the Advanced Build

# Share 🚀

Make a social media post about your final application!

### Deliverables

- Make a post on any social media platform about what you built!

Here's a template to get you started:

# Submitting Your Homework [OPTIONAL]

## Main Homework Assignment

Follow these steps to prepare and submit your homework assignment:

1. Review the MCP server code in `server.py` and the `app/` directory
2. Run the MCP server locally using `uv run server.py`
3. Connect to the server using an MCP client (e.g., Claude Desktop, or a custom client)
4. Test all available tools: browsing products, adding to cart, viewing cart, removing items, and checkout
5. Record a Loom video reviewing what you have learned from this session

## Questions

### ❓ Question #1:

Why is OAuth important for MCP servers, and what security considerations should you keep in mind when exposing tools to AI clients?

#### ✅ Answer:

_(insert your answer here)_

### ❓ Question #2:

What is the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol, and how does it differ from MCP in terms of purpose and architecture? When would you choose A2A over MCP?

#### ✅ Answer:

_(insert your answer here)_

## Activity 1: Extend the MCP Server

Add at least one new tool to the cat shop MCP server (e.g., `search_products`, `update_cart_quantity`, or `get_order_history`). Ensure the new tool integrates properly with the existing database and OAuth authentication. Demo the new tool through an MCP client and include it in your Loom video.

## Advanced Activity: Build a Custom MCP Client

Build a custom MCP client that connects to the cat shop server over Streamable HTTP, authenticates via OAuth, and orchestrates a multi-step shopping flow (browse → add to cart → checkout). Compare the developer experience of MCP-based tool integration vs. traditional REST API calls.

Include your findings and a demo in your Loom video.
