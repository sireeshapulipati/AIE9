    "1. **User Clarification** - Optionally asks clarifying questions to understand the research scope\n",
    "2. **Research Brief Generation** - Transforms user messages into a structured research brief\n",

    "### Phase 1: Clarification\n",
    "The system checked if your request was clear. Since you provided specific details about your sleep issues, it likely proceeded without asking clarifying questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 2: Research Brief\n",
    "Your request was transformed into a detailed research brief that guides the supervisor's delegation strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 3: Supervisor Delegation\n",
    "The supervisor analyzed the brief and decided how to break down the research:\n",
    "- Used `think_tool` to plan strategy\n",
    "- Called `ConductResearch` to delegate to researchers\n",
    "- Each delegation specified a focused research topic (e.g., sleep hygiene, circadian rhythm, blue light effects)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 4: Parallel Research\n",
    "Researchers worked on their assigned topics:\n",
    "- Each researcher used web search tools to gather information\n",
    "- Used `think_tool` to reflect after each search\n",
    "- Decided when they had enough information\n",
    "- Compressed their findings into clean summaries\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 5: Final Report\n",
    "All research findings were synthesized into a comprehensive sleep improvement plan with:\n",

       "# Effectiveness of Supplements for High Altitude Trekking: A Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials\n",
       "\n",
       "## Overview\n",
       "\n",
       "The evidence base for supplement effectiveness in high altitude trekking is limited but growing, with several randomized controlled trials examining various interventions for performance and acclimatization outcomes. A comprehensive network meta-analysis published in 2025 analyzed 20 randomized controlled trials involving 329 participants engaging in physical activities at altitudes above 1,500 meters, providing the most comprehensive evidence to date [1]. The analysis examined eight different dietary interventions including carbohydrate supplementation, iron, antioxidant-rich foods, nitrates, and herbal compounds, measuring outcomes such as maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), heart rate, peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), and perceived exertion.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Iron Supplementation\n",
       "\n",
       "Iron supplementation has produced conflicting results in randomized controlled trials, with effectiveness appearing to vary by population and methodology. The biological rationale for iron supplementation at altitude centers on its role in hemoglobin production, erythropoiesis, and cellular oxygen sensing pathways, particularly the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) system.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Positive Evidence from Peru\n",
       "\n",
       "A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial conducted in Peru demonstrated potential protective effects of intravenous iron supplementation against acute mountain sickness (AMS) [2]. Twenty-four healthy male volunteers from Lima received either intravenous iron(III)-hydroxide sucrose (200 mg) or saline placebo before rapidly ascending to 4,340 meters altitude at Cerro de Pasco.\n",
       "\n",
       "The iron group experienced a 65% smaller increase in AMS symptoms compared to the placebo group (1.2 vs 3.4 points increase, p<0.05). Changes in ferritin levels correlated negatively with changes in AMS scores (R=-0.43, p<0.05), suggesting that higher iron stores were associated with less severe symptoms. The incidence of AMS was 42% in the iron group versus 67% in the placebo group, though this difference was not statistically significant due to the small sample size. Notably, no cases of severe AMS occurred in the iron group, compared to 17% in the placebo group.\n",
       "\n",
       "Importantly, iron supplementation did not affect hematocrit or arterial oxygen saturation, suggesting the protective effect was independent of hemoglobin concentration and likely related to cellular oxygen sensing mechanisms rather than enhanced oxygen transport capacity.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Negative Evidence from China\n",
       "\n",
       "A separate randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial examining Chinese participants traveling from Beijing (~50m) to Lhasa (3,650m) found no significant protective effect of intravenous iron supplementation [3]. Forty-one participants received either intravenous iron sucrose (200 mg) or placebo before flying to altitude, with AMS assessed using the Lake Louise Scoring system for 5 days.\n",
       "\n",
       "While the iron supplementation group showed a numerically lower AMS rate compared to controls (26.3% vs. 52.6% at 24 hours), this difference was not statistically significant (P=0.097). Throughout the 5-day study period, no significant differences in AMS rates were observed between groups, despite significantly higher serum iron concentrations and transferrin saturation rates in the iron group.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Iron Supplementation Summary\n",
       "\n",
       "The network meta-analysis ranked iron supplementation highest for improving heart rate (56.54%) and hematocrit (66.67%) responses at altitude [1]. The conflicting results between studies may reflect population differences, ascent profiles (gradual vs. rapid), or other methodological variations. Current evidence suggests iron supplementation may provide some benefit for altitude acclimatization, particularly in populations with baseline iron deficiency, but results are inconsistent across studies.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Carbohydrate Supplementation\n",
       "\n",
       "Carbohydrate supplementation demonstrated the strongest evidence for improving exercise performance at altitude in the network meta-analysis. Carbohydrate supplementation significantly improved VO2max compared to placebo (SMD = 1.13, 95% CrI: 0.25 to 2.05) and reduced rating of perceived exertion scores (MD = −0.77, 95% CrI: −1.83 to −0.09) with moderate-quality evidence [1].\n",
       "\n",
       "The observed increase in VO2max exceeded the minimally clinically important difference of 1.0 ml/kg/min, suggesting clinical relevance for trekkers and mountaineers. The combination of carbohydrate and glutamine ranked highest for improving peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) with a SUCRA score of 84.54% and perceived exertion with a SUCRA score of 69.37%.\n",
       "\n",
       "The International Olympic Committee (IOC) Nutrition Expert Group specifically recommends that athletes increase their intake of energy and carbohydrates during high-altitude training, supporting these findings from controlled trials.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Nitrate Supplementation\n",
       "\n",
       "Nitrate supplementation via beetroot juice showed promising results for maintaining exercise performance at altitude in a randomized controlled trial during a 20-day military trekking expedition [4]. Twenty-two healthy adults received either beetroot juice (~12.5 mmol nitrate per day) or control supplement starting 3 days before departure and continuing until reaching 4,800m altitude.\n",
       "\n",
       "Beetroot juice significantly increased salivary nitrite levels (p=0.007), which serve as precursors to bioactive nitric oxide. Most importantly, while the control group experienced significant decline in fitness scores at 4,800m compared to baseline (p=0.003), the beetroot juice group showed no decline in fitness (p=0.26). Heart rate recovery following exercise was significantly prolonged in the control group at 4,800m (p<0.01) but remained unchanged in the beetroot juice group (p=0.61).\n",
       "\n",
       "However, nitrate supplementation did not affect the occurrence of high altitude illness (p=1.00), suggesting its benefits are specific to exercise performance rather than altitude acclimatization or AMS prevention. The mechanism likely involves enhancement of the nitrate-nitrite-NO pathway, which regulates blood flow distribution, mitochondrial respiration, and muscle metabolism.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Antioxidant Supplementation\n",

       "The network meta-analysis identified antioxidant-rich foods as one of the eight dietary interventions studied in randomized controlled trials at altitude, though specific details on individual antioxidant compounds were limited in the available evidence [1]. The analysis did not provide separate effect sizes for specific antioxidant compounds such as vitamin C, vitamin E, or alpha-lipoic acid.\n",
       "\n",
       "Current evidence suggests that while antioxidant supplementation is commonly used by altitude trekkers, the randomized controlled trial evidence base for specific antioxidant compounds remains limited. The theoretical rationale involves reducing oxidative stress associated with hypoxic exposure, but more targeted studies are needed to establish effectiveness for specific compounds and dosing protocols.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Other Supplements with RCT Evidence\n",
       "\n",
       "### Rhodiola and Cordyceps Combination\n",
       "\n",
       "The network meta-analysis included rhodiola crenulata combined with cordyceps sinensis as one of the eight dietary interventions studied in randomized controlled trials, though specific effect sizes were not detailed for this combination [1]. These adaptogenic compounds have traditional use for altitude-related applications and represent an area of emerging research interest.\n",
       "\n",
       "### High-Protein Diets and D-Aspartic Acid\n",
       "\n",
       "High-protein dietary interventions and d-aspartic acid supplementation were also included in the network meta-analysis, representing additional approaches studied in randomized controlled trials for altitude applications [1]. However, these interventions ranked lower than carbohydrate supplementation and iron for most outcomes measured.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Clinical Implications and Recommendations\n",
       "\n",
       "Based on the available randomized controlled trial evidence, several supplements show promise for high altitude trekking applications:\n",
       "\n",
       "**Strongest Evidence:**\n",
       "- Carbohydrate supplementation for exercise performance (moderate-quality evidence)\n",
       "- Carbohydrate plus glutamine combination for oxygen saturation and perceived exertion\n",
       "\n",
       "**Moderate Evidence:**\n",
       "- Iron supplementation for cardiovascular responses and hematocrit (conflicting results between populations)\n",
       "- Nitrate supplementation for maintaining exercise performance (single well-designed study)\n",
       "\n",
       "**Limited Evidence:**\n",
       "- Antioxidant-rich foods (included in network analysis but limited specific data)\n",
       "- Adaptogenic herbs like rhodiola and cordyceps combinations\n",
       "\n",
       "## Study Limitations and Research Gaps\n",
       "\n",
       "The current evidence base has several important limitations. Most studies involved relatively small sample sizes (ranging from 20-40 participants), which limits statistical power to detect clinically meaningful differences. The network meta-analysis included only 329 total participants across all 20 studies, highlighting the limited scope of research in this area [1].\n",
       "\n",
       "Population characteristics varied significantly between studies, with the network analysis showing 80.17% male participants and significant geographic variation. The predominance of male subjects limits generalizability to female trekkers, who may have different physiological responses to altitude and supplement interventions.\n",
       "\n",
       "Altitude exposure protocols varied considerably, from gradual ascent profiles to rapid transportation to altitude, making it difficult to compare results across studies. Study durations ranged from 10 days to 7 weeks, and 40.59% of participants exercised at altitudes above 3,500 meters, creating heterogeneity in exposure conditions.\n",
       "\n",
       "Outcome measures were inconsistent across studies, with some focusing on acute mountain sickness prevention, others on exercise performance, and still others on physiological markers. This heterogeneity makes it challenging to draw definitive conclusions about supplement effectiveness for specific altitude-related outcomes.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Future Research Directions\n",
       "\n",
       "Several research priorities emerge from this systematic review. Large-scale, multi-center randomized controlled trials are needed to provide adequate statistical power for detecting clinically meaningful differences in altitude-related outcomes. These studies should include adequate representation of female participants and diverse populations.\n",
       "\n",
       "Standardized outcome measures should be adopted across studies, including validated scales for acute mountain sickness, standardized exercise performance protocols, and consistent physiological monitoring. Long-term follow-up studies are needed to assess whether supplement benefits persist throughout extended altitude exposure.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mechanistic studies combining supplement interventions with detailed physiological monitoring could help clarify the pathways through which effective supplements provide benefits. This could guide the development of more targeted interventions and optimal dosing protocols.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Conclusion\n",
       "\n",
       "The randomized controlled trial evidence for supplement effectiveness in high altitude trekking shows the strongest support for carbohydrate supplementation for exercise performance outcomes. Iron supplementation shows promise but with conflicting results between populations, while nitrate supplementation appears effective for maintaining exercise capacity but not for preventing altitude illness. The evidence base for specific antioxidant compounds remains limited despite their common use by trekkers.\n",
       "\n",
       "Trekkers and mountaineers should prioritize evidence-based interventions, with carbohydrate supplementation having the strongest support for improving exercise performance at altitude. Iron supplementation may provide benefits, particularly for individuals with baseline deficiency, but results are inconsistent. Nitrate supplementation represents a promising intervention for maintaining exercise performance during altitude exposure.\n",
       "\n",
       "Future research should focus on larger, more diverse study populations with standardized outcome measures to strengthen the evidence base for supplement recommendations in high altitude environments.\n",
